# automatic-fortnight
For this project, I picked a neighborhood (i.e. I chose one along the L-train).

First-Avenue and East 14th Street, Manhattan - (East Village, Stuyvesant Park, Stuyvesant Town)
Zip Code: 10003,10009

  Using the geoJSON mapper (see geoJSON notes), make a JSON file that includes the following features:
Your L-train neighborhood marked as a region (e.g. polygon),
The L-train (marked as a gray line),
Other major transportation corridors (e.g. subway lines, major bus routes, or major roads) marked as lines, and
Transit stops on your subway lines and major bus routes (marked as points).

  Using Python and Seaborn package, I also made a PNG file of the station usage statistics on the L-train for the week of December 21st, 2018.
