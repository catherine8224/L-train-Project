The MTA keeps track of the number of people entering and exiting each station via the turnstiles. 
Readings of how many people entered and exited are measured every 4 hours. Some stations measure 
the numbers at midnight, 4am, 8am, noon, 4pm, and 8pm. Others are measured on slightly shifted schedules, 
but always 4 hours apart. For example, the 68th Street-Hunter College station has each turnstile measured 
at 1am, 5am, 9am, 1pm, 5pm, and 9pm. These numbers are recorded as cumulative running totals. For example, 
here is some of the data from the 14 Street- Union Square station for December 21:
